Snap-Chrome-Skitch
==================

Snap Chrome to Skitch is an AppleScript that sends your current tab in Chrome to Skitch for a quick and easy way to capture full page screenshots. 

## Installation

An Application Launcher is required to trigger the script. I prefer [Alfred]("http://www.alfredapp.com/"), although 
any other Application Launcher that can launch AppleScripts will work fine. 

For **Alfred** users: simply open Clip to Skitch.alfredextension to install the extension.

## How to Use

Step 1: Find a super cool webpage you want to clip.  
Step 2: Open Alfred.  
Step 3: Type "clip" to Clip to Skitch.
